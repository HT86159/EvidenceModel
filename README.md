# Evidence Model Implementation in PyTorch - Jupyter Notebook Tutorial

## Overview

This repository contains a step-by-step tutorial for implementing an Evidence Model using PyTorch. The tutorial walks you through the complete process of setting up a simple neural network, creating an evidence-based model for analyzing the model outputs, and plotting decision boundaries. The tutorial is designed to help you understand how evidence-based measures like conflict, ignorance, and non-specificity can be used in machine learning models to enhance decision-making.

## Contents

- `evidence_model_tutorial.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook file containing the tutorial.
- `dataset.pkl`: A dataset used to train and evaluate the neural network model.
- `clf.pth`: Saved model weights for the SimpleNN neural network.

## Requirements

To run this tutorial, you need to have the following libraries installed:

- `torch`: For building and training the neural network model.
- `numpy`: For numerical operations.
- `pickle`: For loading the dataset.
- `matplotlib`: For plotting decision boundaries.

You can install the necessary dependencies using the following command:

```sh
pip install torch numpy matplotlib
```

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**
   
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/evidence_model_pytorch.git
   cd evidence_model_pytorch
   ```

2. **Load the Dataset and Model Weights**
   
   Make sure that the dataset (`dataset.pkl`) and model weights (`clf.pth`) are available in the working directory. These files will be used to load data and the saved model parameters.

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**
   
   Open the Jupyter Notebook (`evidence_model_tutorial.ipynb`) to follow along with the tutorial. To start Jupyter Notebook, run:

   ```sh
   jupyter notebook evidence_model_tutorial.ipynb
   ```

   The notebook will guide you through implementing a simple neural network, the evidence model, and visualizing the decision boundaries.

## Key Components

- **Simple Neural Network (`SimpleNN`)**: A basic neural network implemented using PyTorch with two hidden layers, Dropout, and Softmax for multi-class classification.

- **Evidence Model (`EvidenceModel`)**: A class that computes evidence weights, conflict, non-specificity, and ignorance measures from the neural network's output. This helps in understanding the model's decision-making.

- **Decision Boundary Visualization**: A function to plot decision boundaries and visualize how well the neural network classifies the data points.

## Usage

### Step 1: Implement the Simple Neural Network

The `SimpleNN` class is defined with two hidden layers and an output layer, along with Dropout for regularization. This is the first step in creating a classification model.

### Step 2: Load Dataset and Model Weights

The dataset and model parameters are loaded from files to train and evaluate the model.

### Step 3: Implement the EvidenceModel Class

The `EvidenceModel` class computes metrics like conflict, non-specificity, and ignorance for each data point, providing insights into the quality of evidence generated by the model.

### Step 4: Plotting the Decision Boundaries

The `plot_decision_boundary` function is used to visualize how the neural network has classified the data and how well it performs.

### Step 5: Computing Evidence Measures

The evidence-based measures like `conflict`, `ignorance`, and `non-specificity` are computed for each data point using the `EvidenceModel` class.

## Conclusion

This tutorial provides an in-depth exploration of evidence-based modeling in machine learning using PyTorch. By the end of the tutorial, you should understand how to create a neural network model, compute evidence-based metrics, and visualize the results to evaluate model performance.
